### Transcript

I started playing hockey on the frozen ponds near my home at the age of 4. My father saw in me the potential to live out a dream he had never been able to fulfill for himself. My career lasted until college about twenty years later. But the effects on my life have never gone away. Hockey was my rite of passage to becoming a man but like so many adolescent boys in the sports world, inflicted me with a powerful yet hidden depression, which if left unchecked, threatens all of my relationships including my marriage. Hey everyone, it’s Kit, and this is the Relationship Algorithm.

Terry Real is an author and psychotherapist. And his book, “I Don’t Want To Talk About It”, is a compelling exploration of the invisible, yet nearly universally shared experience, of men struggling with depression across generations.

I read this book cover to cover recently and it felt like I was reading someone writing about my childhood specifically. It’s so easy to fall into the assumptive trap that everything and anything about me is unique and no one else has ever experienced something like that when the opposite is more often true.

Before recently I never thought about myself as depressed. Never even remotely considered it. I managed to always have a good job, provide for my family, enjoy myself watching sports and playing video games with my friends. But at the same time, there were aspects of myself, particularly my anger issues, that to me felt uncontrollable. Like a monster always lurking just below the surface. I believed as long as everyone else around me treats me right we have nothing to worry about.

The kind of depression I normally thought about, overt depression, an extreme loss of energy, unwillingness to move, difficult to get out of bed or face the world, ready to just give up on everything and everyone. But covert depression, as defined by Terry Real in this book, here was the silent killer. This spoke to me in a real way. These men lived what on an average scorecard appeared to be perfectly awesome and successful lives. They could be wildly successful in their work. By all appearances come across as high functioning and perfectly normal. Men who could withstand the immense turmoil inside themselves so long as they kept moving, because stopping meant being with themselves and the idea of facing the darkness within was terrifying.

What I’ve learned is that we all end up adapting one way or other in order to cope. Terry Real refers to these behaviors as addictive defenses and they come in many forms. Every man that suffers from covert depression has theirs. Some are even “acceptable” by society’s standards, like workaholics. Mine is video games. I learned to escape the reality of my childhood by checking out into a game. It was critical to my survival at the time but now served as my own paralyzing addiction, no different from drugs, alcohol, or pain killers.

And so that description of this hidden, covert depression fit me. And as much as I did not want to admit it to myself, I knew that it was true. If I wanted to have full control over myself to be a good husband and a good father, then I first needed to seek out the answers about myself.

I am 100% not a teary eyed, crying type. Well I should say that I’m not anymore. When I was around 10 years old, I cried plenty, including when things went badly for me at the hockey rink. But as I grew older, a teenager, that vulnerability was beaten out of me, literally, as I threw my body around in order to prove myself worthy to my father and my family. So when I say I don’t cry, I’m not exaggerating. But reading through this book, I found myself very emotional and sad reading story after grown men, inflicting terror and emotional violence on their wives and children, recounting tales of their youth which sounded an awful lot like the kind of home I grew up in.

And so it begins to make perfect sense that the kind of depression that lives inside me is a generational trauma passed down to me from my father and to him from his father. The idea of being masculine wasn’t something I created in my head, it was a list of rules that I had to follow. Becoming a man wasn’t something done once and for all, it was given to me on the condition that I never abandon its principles--and if I did stray, then it would be taken away.

So here I was with a choice of glory and privilege and high praise, from my father and everyone I looked up to-- or to not compete, to give up and be abandoned, declared worthless, unmanly. The stakes were very, very high. And while as an adult it doesn’t cross my consciousness that my decisions are being controlled by this very fear-based, performance-based self esteem engine. But I am. And they are. And the consequences are terrible.

That’s why when I do a good job, or I win a game, or my team does well everything is better than good, it’s amazing. But when things go wrong, when I lose, when I fail, when I make mistakes, I collapse and the world around me collapses as well.

Terry Real writes “Boys and men are granted privilege and special status, but only on the condition that they turn their backs on vulnerability and connection. Those who resist are punished for it. Those who lose or who cannot compete are marginalized, rendered all but invisible.”

But the truth is that I can’t earn my self-esteem. I have it or I don’t. Performance based self-esteem magnifies a false internal sense of worth by measuring myself and my achievements against someone or something else and needing to come out on top.

I want to be clear as I talk about a deep and dark subject like depression that this isn’t some sort of inevitability that must just be accepted or dealt with. There is real treatment available and real recovery is possible. The idea of which should be exhilarating for any married couple having this experience.

The challenge lies in the hard work that must be done and felt in order to experience that recovery. And there are three layers to true healing and recovery when it comes to this covert depression.

First the addictive defenses must be disarmed. For my father it was alcohol and for me it is video games. Whatever it is, it is the means by which we are all capable of “self-regulating”, which is the equivalent of taking a medicine that numbs the pain. Playing video games has helped me for many years not feel the pain or despair, but it doesn’t relieve it, it comes back after the game ends (or worse gets me more riled if it happens to be a competitive video game). But it is a short-term pain numbing agent and nothing more. But the reason I never stopped using my self-regulating technique is because of what happened to me when I did. I would begin to exhibit real signs of *overt* depression. And as someone who thinks of himself as functioning, capable, and “i’m fine”, there is nothing more frightening than staring into that abyss of hopelessness and worthlessness.

Which brings me to the second layer, the underlying relationship to self. And this is what can trip up most men. Because to have a mature self-awareness is to be able to acknowledge the fears, or hurt that we have --- things that our peers judge as weakness, unmanly. A mature relationship with myself means I have to risk abandonment, rejection, and dismissal based on how I was brought up. The irony of course being that by holding onto my ill-conceived notion of manhood, I cannot let go of the pain inside me. Some men are at the point in their lives where they are willing and strongly motivated to reconsider their relationships with themselves and their manliness. They might lose their kids, marriage -- or already have. Others like myself, can take years to come around to the notion that I really need to step outside my way of thinking in order to fix what I feel like is unfixable.

In any case, only when a man is open and ready can the final layer be expressed: the childhood trauma that set the whole process in motion.

“Childhood trauma leads to disorders of self-regulation, which can either be felt as over depression or warded off, acted out, as covert depression.”

Appreciating the nature of trauma is key to understanding a recovery process. A trauma memory is a form of re-living.

When I am criticized, in an instant, and for a brief moment, I have a physiological response where I become my adolescent self. I see the person in front of me criticizing me through the lens of my abused past self. There is a technical term for this known as state dependent recall.

So in a way the circuits in our brain have been programmed to respond to our trauma stress in a specific way. Implicit in this is the notion that recovery would be to re-program the brain, which scientists now know can be done, but not by “thinking it” or “knowing it”, it must be felt, experienced.

I’ve never felt anything as intimidating as when after I had come to grips with the fact that I had hurt, realizing that I would have to now face all of that trauma the pieces I had been running away from for years, decades even. So I have nothing but understanding for the men who are not yet ready and nothing but admiration and awe for the men who have turned and stood up to the flames inside.

If it’s hard to hear, then it’s harder still to talk about and now it becomes apparent why this covert form of depression in men is so difficult to address. It would be so easy, so convenient for me to tune it all out, outright deny its existence or its impact, but I happen to be blessed with a stubbornness that turns into my saving grace.

Unless I change myself, then I will continue the legacy of passing down the hurt that was given to me by my parents to my children. And more than anything else in the world I do not want that. So I weaponized my stubbornness against myself. And when the voice in my head says “this is stupid” or “i’m fine”, I think of all those times in my childhood when I wish my father had done differently and I dig deep for the stubbornness to do differently today.

When your wife asks you the question “What’s the matter?” and you say “I don’t want to talk about it”, then the best thing you can possibly do yourself is to find out the real answer why. Thanks for listening.
