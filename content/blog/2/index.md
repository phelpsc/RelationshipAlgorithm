Have you gotten to the bottom of the pull up--- your arms are straight, elbows locked. Which direction is easier to go? Up? Or letting go and dropping down? We are used to letting go. Especially if we're tired, or distracted. Do you know that look your wife gives you? You know that one that says "hey we need to talk - but I'm not sure I want to start talking about it because we might get into an argument?" Well what are you going to do? Are you going to let go of the bar? Or are you going to pull up? Hey everyone it's Kit and this is the Relationship Algorithm.

The pull-up analogy is what I want to use when dealing with difficult conversations.

If you bring up difficult topics you might start fighting. If you ask him to go to therapy it's going to feel like a punishment. So when you go to bring up this topic I want you to imagine your husband hanging from the pull up bar. But guys, this is a child-like mentality for a moment--- if you told him he needed to brush his teeth so he didn't get cavities. It starts with a fundamental decision that EVERYONE has to make for themselves.

My wife is a professional emotional pull-up instructor. She does this in her sleep, she can do them without thinking about it, she can do it while carrying on a separate conversation.

If doing one pull-up is difficult, how much time do you think it would take to be able to do 20 pull-ups without stopping?

So what's the biggest thing we can do to get started? It's a mindset- a mentality. Will you decide to put your relationship mental health up on a pedastal along with basic necessities to function or won't you? If you don't, you risk leaving that up to chance, maybe you'll do a good job of maintaining your relationship without ever thinking about it or being intentional but maybe you won't and you'll grow apart over the years. Who's to say - the statistics don't lie. But you have the choice today. Tomorrow you might not have that option open to you. And I find that a great way to self-motivate: we can often get motivated to be loss-averse. (Offer someone a reward and they can rationalize not doing the challenge, give someone a prize and threaten to take it away and they're much more likely to defend!). What might my marriage look like in 10 years if I don't do anything different?

But there's not enough time in the day, because we're already so busy. Well that's true. You are incredibly busy. You never get time-off from being a parent. Work demands won't stop just because you did a great job last quarter. Chores certainly aren't going anywhere anytime soon. So where do you fit it in? Well where do you fit in the other parts of your life that are required to function? Do you have a gym routine? A getting up in the morning routine? A going to bed routine? Well it turns out that if it's *routine* you are going to do it. And if it's not *routine*, well then push come to shove it's going to get left out. So the answer is turning the "it" in relationship upkeep into *routine* so that it doesn't take active thought, so it doesn't consume precious brain calories in order to happen. (We're going to have an entire episode on just this concept and how to achieve it)

Exercise: EMOTIONAL PULL-UP

Caveat: The goal is FORM not REPETITIONS. It does us no good to practice or perfect half- or quarter- reps. You have to go through the full motion in order to see gains.

What qualifies as a full form pull up? It comes down to this: can you open up (or receive/listen) a conversation that pertains to how you or your spouse is feeling.

Example of how it can open up: my wife comes to me and says "hey something is bothering me, i need to talk". Decision point of doing the pull-up vs letting go- I say, "Yes let's talk". She might tell me that she's feeling overwhelmed because she's behind on her work and can't find the time to make it back up because the kids extra-curricular activities. Or she might say something that hits closer to home- "I felt abandoned when you got up right after dinner and went straight to your computer, while I had to finish putting everything away." The content isn't what's too important here but what counts is can you HAVE that conversation without AVOIDING it, PUSHING it away, or worst yet RETALIATING/ESCALATING. If you can listen to everything she has to say and give her some empathy and understanding - that counts as one pull-up.

So your homework is then to see how hard it is to do one pull-up. After you have that conversation, how do you feel? Are you feeling exhausted? Do you feel the need to do something to settle back down or relax? Like open up Youtube? Netflix? Email? Instagram? Grab a drink? Ask yourself, how hard was that? Could you do another right now? That's it. Each time the opportunity comes up to have an authentic conversation with your spouse- see how your body is up for it, both before and after. Did you do a full rep? Or were you only able to do half? This is the kind of information you need so that you can be honest with yourself about where you're starting.

Like I've mentioned before you don't go on your first day ever at the gym and throw a bunch of heavy plates on the bar and crank it out. And that's OK! There's nothing wrong with that and there's nothing wrong with being mentally, physically, and emotionally exhausted with having a conversation about feelings in your marriage. But now that you have that knowledge you're in a position to make a choice about how you want to proceed. And if you're in the mindset about taking great care of your relationship then that choice is easy to make.

That's all for this edition of the Relationship Algorithm.
