### Transcript

Yesterday was the perfect day. A perfect storm of events that brought out all of my old habits, the tendencies that I’ve worked so hard, so diligently to break. My wife and I were exhausted, one of my daughters was feeling a bit ill, the house was a mess and needed cleaning, chores were piled up, and I absolutely needed to make a ton of progress for a crucial work deadline. What’s the point of it? All my work to prevent angry outbursts, general impatience, and buried feelings of depression - does it really go out the window so quickly when the going gets tough? It turns out, this is exactly what transformation looks like and I’m thrilled that today I get to share with you all the details of my perfectly rough day. Hey everyone, it’s Kit, and this is the Relationship Algorithm.

The Relationship Algorithm is a podcast from Kinship For Couples, where our goal is to educate everyone of the importance of preventative maintenance for your relationship. Please check us out at kinshipforcouples.com or find me on Instagram at Kit_at_Kinship.

I think today’s podcast episode might be the most important one I’ve recorded to date because the topic, managing expectations and understanding what transformation is (and what it isn’t), is so vital to being successful in the long run.

A long while back I sat in my therapist’s office, he asked me what my goal was and I said “to get over my anger”, and he said “ok, what’s your plan?” and two things dawned on me. One, I didn’t have a plan. I knew what I wanted, but I didn’t have a plan to make it happen. Without a plan, what I want to have happen is little more than wishful thinking. And two, my goal was completely unattainable.

What I’ve learned in the years since then is that the transformation I needed to undergo was not one where I “fixed what was broken”. That mindset is a trap and for me yesterday was proof of that.

So what I’d like to talk about today is what exactly do I mean when I say “transformation”, and what is needed to transform?

Positive transformation in my relationship is not the absence of negative feelings. I’ll repeat that because it bears emphasizing: positive transformation is not the absence of negative feelings, bad thoughts, lousy days, arguments with myself or others. Life happens. It is going to continue to happen, and it’s going to happen when you least expect, when you most don’t want it to. This is unavoidable.

Positive transformation is the power to choose how I respond when life happens. In the moments that follow, after my body has had its natural reaction, my transformation looks like this: I am aware of what is happening to me, I accept, rather than deny/refute it, and knowing  that I make a choice about how I want to be.

I tend to find examples the best way to illustrate. So one particular morning, the weather was lousy - steady rain - which meant the dog and I both got soaked going outside. I hadn’t gotten a great night’s rest, someone with a cough woke me up in the middle of the night, it was very interrupted sleep. You could say that my wife and I, and our children all got up on the wrong side of the bed. No one wanted to get ready for school, someone had forgotten to do their homework and everything felt arduous, rushed, and difficult. By the time 9am had come, both my wife and I felt thoroughly exhausted, as if we had already put in a full day’s worth of work.

We had just dropped the kids off at the bus stop, and were sitting in our driveway, both of us needing to get going to get to work. We felt defeated. And in that moment, I grabbed my wife’s hand, told her exactly how I was feeling, and that I was feeling every urge to run away and hide, to numb out from the world. I told her that I was done adulting and that everything felt really unfair. I said I wanted to reclaim my day. I suggested that we sneak in a morning coffee date on the way into work, and so we went. We sat in a cute little cafe near our home, still raining outside, and we both got to have a few minutes just venting about all of the nonsense, and all of the frustration, and in those moments we also started to find the things we were grateful for - in each other and our family, and the things that we were looking forward to and wanted to accomplish. We took a deep breath and a few sips of coffee and came up with a plan for how we were going to win the day. And when we left the shop and went our separate ways a few minutes later it was like we had just won a huge battle. I felt very connected and re-energized.

So if I were to break down the example then I would say that “life happening” was everything from waking up in the middle of the night all the way through to dropping the kids off at the bus stop. So much of that is, and will always be, outside of my control. Yes, things like keeping your environment clean, building great habits for yourself and your kids, all of this can go a long way to preventing morning rushes and last minute breakdowns but even the best laid plans sometimes fail us. Life happens. And I would go absolutely mad trying to “never mess up”. So all of those little things, that tired energy, that sluggishness, that feeling of things being “unfair” or “ruined” - that’s just life.

My positive transformation is again two parts. The first is my awareness of the situation. In years past, I know I’ve lived that same morning at least a dozen or more times, those days defeated me. I would feel lousy at work, do a bad job at work, and remain largely checked out even coming home at the end of the day -- in other words I didn’t not have awareness of how much things affected me, or how intense the feelings I had were. But fast forward to present day, now I know that admitting that I feel lousy about having a terrible morning is not a weakness, but a vital first step in overcoming it! Yes, my own awareness about something as simple as what’s happening around me and to me and inside me is a HUGE DEAL and an incredible positive transformation.

It is no easy feat to have self-awareness when bad things are happening. But the information it provides me is critical because it is what enables the second half of my positive transformation: CHOICE.

Going back to my example the climax is what happens when the morning is over and my wife and I are now off for the day. How do we part ways? What energy do we take with us? How connected are we? What are the stories we are telling ourselves about what we did, or the other one did or how we’re feeling?

And again, in the near recent past, a morning like that would have had me running for the hills. I would have raced to get on my computer, under the pretext of “getting to work” and probably gone straight into numbing out until whatever meeting would come up on my calendar that I’d daydream my way through. That doesn’t sound like someone who is “unaffected” by what happened in the morning, and yet, that’s how I considered myself.

The second half of my positive transformation, and what really puts this into action and where I can experience the results, is something that happens in a single moment.

I make a choice.

And I don’t want to overcomplicate this, because it truly is as simple as this. Step one, have the awareness about what’s going on. Step two, make a choice.

In making a choice, I exercise my power to affect my being rather than being a passive receiver to whatever the world is sending my way. I wasn’t any less tired, or cranky, or frustrated - but I was able to share those feelings with my wife, have them heard in a way that didn’t make her respond defensively, but allowed us to share a moment of connection, reminding us of the good we have in our relationship and parting ways with love.

So let’s talk about what’s needed in order to experience this two-part, positive transformation.

It starts with the why. So I have two questions for you, and if the answer to both of these isn’t a firm yes, then what I have to share probably won’t resonate and won’t work. Do you want to be in your relationship? Are you willing to do the work that it takes to stay in that relationship?

Once you’ve made that commitment explicit, and it’s important that you do, you can take the next steps that will set you up to practice awareness and to practice choice.

Awareness in the context of this discussion, is primarily an internal awareness. And to gain that, I have to understand my own habits and tendencies.

My brain is always working to make connections, to build routine, habits. To optimize for the sake of conserving energy. It’s been doing this since the day I was born and throughout my childhood my brain formed a lot of habits, patterns. I like to refer to them as circuits that have been programmed in. When I repeat a behavior, I reinforce the circuit, the connection between those neurons becomes stronger - a closer bond, a deeper rut. The only way I can change these, is by bringing attention to it.

For instance, if every time I wake up, I roll over and reach for my phone, I will continue to do that unless I pay attention to it. Maybe I’ll do something like, set my phone in the other room before I go to bed. Then when I wake up I have to walk to that room to get my phone and that walk gives my brain an opportunity to “catch” what is going on before it’s already happened.

Habits that can be paid attention to can be modified. And I am not doing it justice here in this brief dialogue but I want to be sure to note that at the core of all relationships are a set of habits and behaviors, most of which happen to us automatically and out of our awareness.

The practice here is the art of putting your brain on manual transmission instead of automatic.

To do this, start with one thing that you know you do reliably, almost every day if possible - and everytime that happens from now on, see if you can’t make a mental note to yourself that says “a ha, I am doing this thing now, did I choose to do it?”

Next, practicing choice. This practice can be fun, albeit a bit absurd. When you’re feeling refreshed and up for it try this out. For as long as you can keep it up, announce out loud what you are doing and preface it by saying, “I choose to…”

Your wife might look at you funny. If your kids are young enough, they might think it’s hilarious and start joining in.

Making each action its own declaration does a few things. One, it will become very clear very quickly that you are making a LOT of decisions. Constantly! Two, making the declaration itself gives your mind a momentary ability to go a different direction. The habit of announcing and then seeing the possibilities of different actions and then walking the path you choose for yourself is, in and of itself, a kind of neural pathway that you WANT to nourish. Doing this, even for fun, at a high enough frequency, will train your brain to collect the awareness, evaluate the potential, and make a choice.

Doing this in your relationship will result in the kind of positive transformation that will last your relationship a lifetime.
