### Notes

* What does the best version of your relationship look like? Is it where you are now?
* We know that brushing our teeth is the key to good dental hygiene. What's the equivalent for your long term relationship?
* Grant study [75+ years longitudinal] what contributes to happiness, health, and longevity: one thing affecting needed at least one secure attachment to another person
* The practices offered here are science based, research backed, and most importantly - measurable. Why is it important that we can measure what we're doing? Change is going to be small and incremental, so being able to keep track over a long period of time will be critical for measuring success.
* You don't walk into the gym out-of-shape on Monday and leave on Friday as an Olympic athlete.
* Athletes train their bodies in order to memorize a task so they can perform it at the highest level possible. If they don't practice enough, or practice well enough, then when it comes game time - they have to think about what or how to do it. The act of going into their head at the time of execution, inhibits performance. That's why you'll always see at the free throw line, if they miss they "got into his head".
* The same principle is at play here in your relationship. You have to practice some things that are beyond what your prefrontal cortex brain can "logic" through. The mindset has to be open to training a different type of muscle. Muscles in your body, your brain and intelligence, and here is your emotional body - the strength and stamina of which we now measure.
* Another mindset is to realize that most of the work that is there to be done is going to be on yourself, between you and yourself. And that work is going to be difficult especially if it's not a muscle you've ever worked before.
* Let me give an example: Eye contact. Eye contact is the emotional deadlift. It is a compound emotional exercise that engages entire systems in our body and our mind. We now have science that shows how all of this pieces together in the puzzle that is our relationships. So have a mindset of being ready to train.
* Open minded. Are you willing to learn new things? What we've learned about relationships throughout our lives, is mostly from flawed sources - how many of us have had a healthy, secure attachment modeled for us? Because most of us don't have that example, we have in ourselves a lot of hidden biases and beliefs on how things work. It is no small feat to change that.
* Mindset of awareness: we are survival oriented species, knee-jerk parts of the brain that require error correction by the higher parts of the brain (when we're under stress those parts of the brain are compromised)
	* shoots first asks questions later
	* Bringing awareness and intention to what you're body is doing is going to be key.
	* But remember, we're not here to be perfect. We're here to improve. A little bit every day over the long run will pay off enormous dividends. Cooking one meal isn't enough to get healthy, writing one sentence doesn't finish the novel, and being open and introspective with yourself for one morning won't allow you to master self-regulation - but all of these are the correct first step on a journey.

## Final Recap:
1. Start small. Stay consistent. Expect change to happen incrementally. Commit for the long haul.
2. It's not thinking or doing or fixing. Feeling is an entireLY different muscle to train.
3. You have to look inward for the answers.
4. Track and measure.
5. We're not after perfection. We're not trying to never fight with our partners.
