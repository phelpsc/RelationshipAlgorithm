The state of our body and the emotions present in it provide extremely valuable information that we ignore to our own detriment.

### Transcript

If someone asks you “how are you feeling?”, how do you respond? For most of my life I would have selected from one of three predetermined responses: ok, good or fine. My therapist recently revealed to me that the word “fine” was actually an acronym standing for ‘feelings I’m not expressing.’ And while that may or may not have been terribly clever of him, it does touch on the fact that there is an entire universe of emotions and feelings out there, that manifest themselves physically in our bodies, and if we can become of aware of them one of our absolute best sources of information we can gain from the world. But it takes practice. So, how are YOU feeling? Hey everyone it’s Kit, and this is the Relationship Algorithm.

A couple of quick housekeeping items before I get started. I’ve been tinkering a bit with the format and length of the podcast and decided that for now I’m going to keep things a bit flexible. So for instance, today’s episode is going to be shorter than average since I feel good about getting all the information that’s needed in the length that it is. I don’t want to have fluff or filler. So each episode will go until the thought is complete. Alright with that out of the way, enjoy!

There are two kinds of correct answers and one type of wrong answer. The wrong answer, as just mentioned, is the ‘empty calorie’, canned responses -- fine, good, bad, ok, meh. So if you take only one thing away from today’s podcast it would be this: never answer the question “How are you feeling?” with one of those words again. Take it upon yourself as a personal challenge, come up with some other word or words to give.

So let’s examine that. One perfectly good answer is the state of your body. These physical sensations should be easy and straightforward to recognize: hungry, cold, tired. They speak to your current physical state and provide you with literally life-saving information. If your body never told you it was hungry, or thirsty, or sleepy we could easily find ourselves distracted to the point of physical collapse.

The other category of answer are the emotions present in your body. Think of the movie “Inside Out” and start with the basics: Joy, Anger, Sadness, Fear, and Disgust. Those are all distinct and straightforward emotions you could be experiencing and they all have their reasons for existing and providing you with information.

This is the second fundamental takeaway from today’s episode: every single feeling you can experience -- even the ones with horribly negative connotations (grief, hate, repulsion, horror, anguish, bored, heartbroken, overwhelmed) -- they all exist for a good reason. They provide information. They push you towards something known as an adaptive action response. Fear energizes the body in a way that can help you escape. Anger puts you in a position to draw a boundary to protect yourself. All forms of sadness make it easier for you to reach out and ask for help or connection. Disgust will compel you to reject that which is toxic. And so on and so forth.

There is a real risk of denying and suppressing the feelings we feel and that is the loss of the value of the information they present to us. If we are angry but do not acknowledge it, then we don’t put up our defenses, we don’t have boundaries. The common occurrence for myself is when I am upset but want to deny it, I bottle it up. I push it down. I declare my “fine”-ness to myself, my wife and the world. But there is a limit to how much I can hold and when I hold so much that I finally can’t take anymore I explode. And when I’ve had such episodes I can say things that I deeply regret, take actions that hurt those around me including the people I care about the most. All of this can be traced back to my actions surrounding my awareness and acceptance of the feelings present in me.

One of the most difficult aspects of feelings for me to grasp is the notion that they exist physically in the body. Why does that sound silly or nonsensical to me? When it fact it makes perfect sense and there’s a LOT of research and science behind it.

So while each of us in our own have to grapple with the idea that the entire range of feelings are evolutionarily wired into all of our bodies, here are two bits of information that might be helpful:

Feelings show up in our bodies as sensations. Constriction of muscles, feeling heavy or light, pressure in our around the joints, tension in the face or shoulders or back, sinking or fluttering in the gut. It happens all over.
Uninterrupted feelings, that is to say, feelings that we do not consciously alter or suppress, are wave-like in nature. They approach, build, crest, and then subside.

That second bit is particularly important to hear. Because for me, I was taught to actively suppress and avoid feelings that were considered unmanly, inappropriate, or just negative and bad to have. So things like sadness, anxiety, shyness, shame - I was taught to stifle all of these.

Feelings are not endless, but attempts to numb them can last a lifetime.

If I don’t allow a feeling to proceed though its natural wavelike cadence, what happens is it gets stuck. Literally. Physically. Stuck in my body. I’ve stopped it and it collects. The reason why things like stress or depression and other mental disorders physically impact us lives in this world of feelings manifested as physical sensation in the body. Years and years of bottled up anger, becoming rage, hatred, and all manner of ugliness - takes a toll on the body.

The fact that I could live a healthier life simply by allowing my feelings to be felt and expressed is one of my biggest regrets. Expressing sadness is not weakness. It is a path to immense relief, connection, and good health.

For guys out there like me, who don’t really want to share how we’re feeling with others (or even to ourselves), I get it. I really do.

This is something that you have to experience for yourself in order to know it. You cannot be told how something feels, you have to feel it yourself.

I have a strategy to offer, however. I don’t like jumping into a hot tub, I want to get in a little bit at a time. Same idea here. If feelings are foreign or not present for you, if you’re like me and “just fine” or “don’t get sad”, great. Start by having this exploration as an inner dialogue only. Don’t feel the need to go full on telling everyone everything or having to be something that you’re not. Even the absence of a feeling is valuable information to have. If something objectively sad is happening around you and you search your body and you don’t feel anything, pay attention to that! That’s good information. And for now, keep it to yourself. Try this out in the privacy of your own home, in the mirror, without anyone watching. Close your eyes when you’re relaxing in your favorite chair. Test it out when you’re driving somewhere by yourself. Anyplace you can go to not feel judged or like you have to perform, awesome. Ask yourself how you’re feeling and find one or two words that aren’t “fine”.

If you fail and can’t think of anything, just keep at it. That’s perfectly normal. In fact, for now, that’s just fine. Thanks for listening.
